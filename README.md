# Wolf3d v1

## Description

Based on the excelent work made by Nhyarlathotep:

https://github.com/Nhyarlathotep/Wolf3D-wasm

https://github.com/Nhyarlathotep/Wolf3D-react-editor

The purpose was to adapt to the ggez/gwg framework and make it a binary instead of lib.
Also, ggez/gwg supports compilation to WASM target so the best of both worlds.

You can navigate on the first level of the original game.
